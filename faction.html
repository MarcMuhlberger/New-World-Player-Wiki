            Factions are going to be a major decision. You only get one chance to redo your choice, so make the first decision
            count. When looking to join a faction, a good place to start is understanding who is joining them.

            <div class="p2 burn">
             Most of the players will refer to this faction as “Hufflepuff” due to the colors being yellow and red.
             Covenant success ranges from server to server, for instance, the server world of Macaria the Covenant has domination of the map. However, worlds like 
             Oponskoye and Vingolf the covenant are amongst the weakest.

            <div class="p2 burn">
                Marauders or also known as “Slytherin”, are the landlocked pirates. Players in the Marauders tend to be more serious, which brings a lot of might but also a lot of hours spent
                defending your vast borders. Most servers see the Marauders as the brutes who will do anything to win.

            <div class="p2 burn">
                Syndicate or also known as “The Illuminati”, are the plague doctors of the game because their high-tier faction armor grants them plague doctor masks. Most players for Syndicate tend to be casual players, who seem to only enjoy the game in reasonable hours. 
                Sadly this comes at a cost as many other factions who have the night owls will take advantage of this and attack when they are sleeping.

                <div class="p3"style="padding: 2vw;">Outnumbered. However, this in return makes the most soulful players to play along with as they are fighting the losing battle and will go in with 110%.</div>

                <h4>Joining the Middle Faction</h4>
                <div class="p3" style="padding: 2vw;">For the centrists out there, the middle faction will most likely be the safest choice, as depending on the state of the companies they may only be in their position due to lack of leadership or 
                    organization. These factions most likely will hold the casuals who range from 9-5 workers to midnight gamers.</div>

                <h4>Joining a Winning Faction</h4>
                <div class="p3" style="padding: 2vw;">Most likely the companies within the winning factions will be filled, 
                    as they are already high level and don’t wish to pick up anyone who cannot contribute. This will make it harder for you as a new player to feel wanted early on</div>
